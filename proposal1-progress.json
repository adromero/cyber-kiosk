Event delegation working for main controls but not dynamic timer buttons. Added verbose logging - shows clicks detected on parent divs but 'No button with data-action found'. Timers start correctly, alarms work. Need to inspect HTML to verify data attributes rendering. Possible causes: innerHTML updates breaking delegation, or attributes not rendering in template literals. User testing via Tailscale from laptop.

Fixed response parsing for v6's new structure (queries.total instead of stats.summary.total_queries). Added fallback_iframe URL (http://100.90.104.35/admin) to all error responses for future frontend integration. Authentication now working: 39,260 queries, 74.8% blocked. Also fixed modal close button (X) not working - issue was event listener attached before DOM element existed. System infrastructure now fully operational. NO PROPOSAL1 TASKS - this was system maintenance/debugging."

Added settings gear icon to dashboard header with rotating hover effect. 700+ lines of cyberpunk-themed CSS for settings page. Grid layout editor allows custom dimensions (1-4 rows/cols), tap-to-place panels, drag-to-move, resize controls, and proportional scaling. Phase 4 complete: 7/7 tasks.

WIDGET MODE: Compact calendar for homescreen with mini month view, navigation, today button, event indicators, 3 upcoming events. Added 630+ lines of CSS (440 modal + 190 widget). FIXES APPLIED: Fixed modal scrolling (removed overflow constraints), added calendar to settings.html panel list, added calendar container to index.html (grid-panel-6), added calendar mappings to grid-layout-manager.js. BUGS DISCOVERED: Widget shows blank space on homescreen despite container existing - may be rendering issue, initialization timing problem, or CSS conflict. Modal click works correctly. User reported blank widget after enabling in settings and adding to grid layout. STATUS: Core implementation complete but needs debugging before marking task complete. NEXT SESSION MUST: Debug widget rendering, add console logging to CalendarPanel.renderContainer(), verify container.innerHTML is being set, check CSS display properties, test event sync between modes."

Clicking widget header still opens full modal calendar. TECHNICAL CHANGES: Replaced renderCompactMonth() and renderUpcomingMini() with new renderDayView() method, updated event handlers for prev-day/next-day navigation, completely rewrote calendar widget CSS (~200 lines) with day-specific classes (.calendar-day-header, .calendar-day-nav, .calendar-day-date, .calendar-day-events, etc.). Grid layout already properly configured (1 col × 2 rows). Design follows cyberpunk theme with cyan borders, neon glows, large typography. Touch-friendly with 40-44px button heights.

IMPLEMENTATION: Created VideoPanel class (380 lines) extending BasePanel with showModal/hideModal, video rotation, event delegation. Added HTML container (grid-panel-7, data-panel-id='video'). Added initVideoPanel() function in app.js. Added comprehensive CSS (245+ lines) for modal overlay, video embed (16:9 responsive iframe), video selector list, thumbnail view with play icon overlay, hover effects. BUGS FIXED: Initial 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading autoplay)' error - changed this.config to this.settings (BasePanel uses settings not config). Missing CSS for modal - added complete video-modal-* classes. Video panel now fully functional with rotating thumbnails and modal playback. Grid layout configured at row 2, col 0, 1x2 size.

Modal view shows detailed stats: large CPU temp, 2x2 grid (CPU usage, GPU temp, Memory, Disk with percentages and absolute values), system info (uptime, load averages, status), refresh button.

HTML container (grid-panel-8, data-panel-id='system'). initSystemPanel() in app.js. Updated temperature click handler to use system panel modal (fallback to old modal if not initialized). CSS: Added 350+ lines for widget/modal styling. Added grid-panel-8 to responsive.css grid areas. Added .grid-panel-8:hover to cyberpunk.css for panel zoom effect (other themes need same update). Added .system-widget-compact:hover for inner content zoom. System panel fully functional with both widget and modal modes. Panel registry already included system panel definition.
