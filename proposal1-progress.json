BUGS TO FIX: Widget may not render properly on homescreen (blank space), modal scrolling works but needs testing, event sync between widget/modal needs verification, container initialization timing issues. See session 9 notes for details. NEXT SESSION: Debug widget rendering, test event creation/deletion in both modes, verify localStorage sync, test on actual Pi 7-inch screen."

Touch improvements: 44-50px buttons, 2px borders, larger fonts, touch-action manipulation, scrollbar styling. BLOCKER: Pause/stop buttons render but don't trigger click events. Event delegation working for main controls but not dynamic timer buttons. Added verbose logging - shows clicks detected on parent divs but 'No button with data-action found'. Timers start correctly, alarms work. Need to inspect HTML to verify data attributes rendering. Possible causes: innerHTML updates breaking delegation, or attributes not rendering in template literals. User testing via Tailscale from laptop.

Updated authentication flow to extract both sid and csrf from login response, send proper headers with API requests. Fixed response parsing for v6's new structure (queries.total instead of stats.summary.total_queries). Added fallback_iframe URL (http://100.90.104.35/admin) to all error responses for future frontend integration. Authentication now working: 39,260 queries, 74.8% blocked. Also fixed modal close button (X) not working - issue was event listener attached before DOM element existed. System infrastructure now fully operational. NO PROPOSAL1 TASKS - this was system maintenance/debugging."

Display tab has CRT effects, animations, font size, and refresh interval settings. About tab shows system info.

Added settings gear icon to dashboard header with rotating hover effect. 700+ lines of cyberpunk-themed CSS for settings page. Grid layout editor allows custom dimensions (1-4 rows/cols), tap-to-place panels, drag-to-move, resize controls, and proportional scaling. Phase 4 complete: 7/7 tasks.

MODAL MODE: Click date in header opens full calendar with month view navigation, event creation/deletion, 5 event types (reminder/meeting/task/birthday/other), upcoming events list. WIDGET MODE: Compact calendar for homescreen with mini month view, navigation, today button, event indicators, 3 upcoming events. Added 630+ lines of CSS (440 modal + 190 widget). FIXES APPLIED: Fixed modal scrolling (removed overflow constraints), added calendar to settings.html panel list, added calendar container to index.html (grid-panel-6), added calendar mappings to grid-layout-manager.js. BUGS DISCOVERED: Widget shows blank space on homescreen despite container existing - may be rendering issue, initialization timing problem, or CSS conflict. Modal click works correctly. User reported blank widget after enabling in settings and adding to grid layout. STATUS: Core implementation complete but needs debugging before marking task complete. NEXT SESSION MUST: Debug widget rendering, add console logging to CalendarPanel.renderContainer(), verify container.innerHTML is being set, check CSS display properties, test event sync between modes."
