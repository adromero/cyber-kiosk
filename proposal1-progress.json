Updated authentication flow to extract both sid and csrf from login response, send proper headers with API requests. Fixed response parsing for v6's new structure (queries.total instead of stats.summary.total_queries). Added fallback_iframe URL (http://100.90.104.35/admin) to all error responses for future frontend integration. Authentication now working: 39,260 queries, 74.8% blocked. Also fixed modal close button (X) not working - issue was event listener attached before DOM element existed. System infrastructure now fully operational. NO PROPOSAL1 TASKS - this was system maintenance/debugging."

      "notes": "Created full-featured settings page with 4 tabs (Theme, Panels, Display, About). Theme tab has visual preview cards for all 3 themes with live switching. Panel tab has toggle switches for 8 panels. Display tab has CRT effects, animations, font size, and refresh interval settings. About tab shows system info. Added SettingsManager class with localStorage integration, unsaved changes warning, modal dialogs. Backend API: GET/POST /config/panels for loading/saving, POST /config/panels/reset for defaults. Added settings gear icon to dashboard header with rotating hover effect. 700+ lines of cyberpunk-themed CSS for settings page. Skipped drag-and-drop panel positioning (p4-t4) - deferred to future enhancement. Phase 4 complete: 6/7 tasks (1 skipped). Ready for Phase 5 (Install & Migration)."
